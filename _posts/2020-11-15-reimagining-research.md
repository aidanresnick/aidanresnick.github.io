# Statistical Question

Do people who are on social media have more social relationships than people who are not on social media?

# Population

The population should not exclude anyone, as everybody with a technological device or with a peer who has a technological device plausibly could have a social media account.

# Sample Frame

In order to ensure that this study is not observational, I would ensure that my sample frame is a random sample of people who currently do not have social media.

# Sampling Method

Within this sample frame, I believe interval sampling is the most effective form of sampling because we are able to account for any member of the sample frame at random. Additionally, interval sampling ensures that there are not too many members of the sample who come from the exact same background or share a common characteristic, avoiding potential bias.

# Hypotheses

My null hypothesis is people who are on social media do not have more social relationships than people who are not on social media. To that end, my alternative hypothesis is people who are on social media have more social relationships than people who are not on social media.

# Variables and Treatments

The variable among people in my sample is whether or not they download a social media account. The treatment is downloading social media and using it to connect with people and the control is merely taking note of its interactions.

# Treatment Groups

Among the members of the sample, everyone is randomly assigned to one of the two groups.

# Experiment

In this experiment, the members of the treatment group will download social media accounts, either Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter, while the members of the control group will not download any social media and will continue to live their lives normally, taking note of their social encounters- specifically, their daily encounters and their reaction to them. After approximately six months, enough time for the treatment group to form any social media relationships they would like to form, I will keep track of the number of followers, likes, comments, and direct messages of the treatment group and the social interactions of the control group. Then, they will be compared. The number of interactions will be noted, but the most important piece of information is the number of consistent relationships. Each person who consistently likes, comments, and messages a person in the treatment group on social media, they will receive credit for a social media connection. Similarly, each member of the control group will receive credit for a consistent relationship. These values will be compared in order to determine whether or not we have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.
