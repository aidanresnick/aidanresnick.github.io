# Statistical Question

Do people who are on social media have more social relationships than people who are not on social media?

# Population

The population should not exclude anyone, as everybody with a technological device or with a peer who has a technological device plausibly could have a social media account.

# Sample Frame

In order to ensure that this study is not observational, I would ensure that my sample frame is a random sample of people who currently do not have social media.

# Sampling Method

Within this sample frame, I believe interval sampling is the most effective form of sampling because we are able to account for any member of the sample frame at random. Additionally, interval sampling ensures that there are not too many members of the sample who come from the exact same background, avoiding potential bias.

# Hypotheses

My null hypothesis is people who are on social media do not have more social relationships than people who are not on social media. To that end, my alternative hypothesis is people who are on social media have more social relationships than people who are not on social media.
